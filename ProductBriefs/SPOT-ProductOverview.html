# SPOT Product Overview

## ABOUT SPOT

SPOT compliance and security risks platform, is a mobile
platform that allows complete and tighter control of any 3rd
party introduced to production network. SPOT supplies full
visibility into the supply chain, spotting hidden OT cyber
vulnerabilities. SPOT yields automatic reports and
recommendations with threat intelligence incorporation.
SPOT smoothly assimilate into plant’s operational routine,
with patch, asset management and configuration integration.

## SPOT Version 2.0 Key capabilities
### Easy and simple to use

- Easy and simple setup - 2 minutes to configure, 5 minutes for scan
results
- Plug and play – no spans ports or changes to the machine’s network
### Asset misconfiguration and vulnerabilities discovery

- Smart Analytics – each asset is analyzed and searched for unsecure
configurations such as default credentials, weak authentication etc.
- Known vulnerabilities discovery – using Otorio’s threat intelligence
DB, SPOT lists all known vulnerabilities found in the machine
### Compliance and policy enforcement
- Minimum allowed versions – each asset can be checked against a
pre-define list of allowed versions
- Machine baseline – finds deviations from a configured base-line. The
baseline capabilities include assets allowed versions, windows users,
open ports and much more.
### Automated reports

- Each risk has a clear remediation guideline
- Reports are generated as PDF and CSV
- Can be integrated with RAM

## Rugged and mobile device
SPOT uses military-grade laptop for mobility and reliability in
harsh environments. By combining powerful hardware,
15.6-inch touch screen and light weight rugged chassis, it’s the
perfect appliance for the job.

It equipped with various connectors such as: RJ-45, serial,
HDMI, VGA, USB3 and many more.

## Scan Setup

### Appliance settings

Appliance settings

- Configurate SPOT IP addressNetwork
- configure credentials for the scan`
  - Deployment
- Add vendors / line-builders identifiers and names
- Tuggle and control the analyzers and alerts you want to check
according to internal or external policies

### Connect spot to the Machine under test

- spot is connected to the machine using its RJ-45 port.
### Scan settings

- Each scan is given a name, vendor identifier, configured policy
to check compliance too and the wanted assets to scan.
- The assets list can be configured as a subnet, range or single IP
addresses list.
- Clicking the “start scan” will initiate the scan.

## Scan process
spOT scan usually takes between 5 - 15 minutes. The scan is done in
three stages

### Asset discovery phase
spot finds all the assets communicating over the network using
unique, non-intrusive active discoveries abilities.

### Asset analyzing phase
For each found asset spOT discovers its type, vendor, product
family and version.
It finds security miss-configurations, default credentials usage and
policies deviations.
spOT analyzes windows machines in the network and search for
security issues and compliance deviations.

### Threat intel phase

For each found asset spot searches its offline vulnerabilities
data-base, constructed by Otorio’s threat intel team, and finds all
known vulnerabilities on each asset.


## Scan report
The scan report is generated automatically after the scan. It gathers
all the security and compliance issues
### Total risk and compliance score

A total risk score, between 0 – 100, and a total compliance score are
presented. They take into account the total number of assets, their
type and the total number of issues found in the machine. Using the
total scores, you can easily compare results between machines.

### Issues table

All the issues are gathered in a table, order by their severity. The
issues are divided into two categories – security and compliance
All issues have a clear remediation guideline and a user comment
section.

## Export report to PDF

The generated report can be automatically exported to PDF format
for you to share it with the vendor, supplier or colleague.
It contain all the issues with the user comments on them

## Scans history and vendors trends

All the scans reports are gathered in a single place where you can
view, edit comments and export several scans reports at once.
Automatically generated vendors and suppliers’ trends such as
average risk score, risks and compliance over time and more.
