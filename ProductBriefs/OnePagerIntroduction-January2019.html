Times are Changing
Traditional industries worldwide are undergoing a technological transformation, often referred to as
Industry 4.0, smart production, or industrial digitalization. Along with the promising business opportunities this brings,
the expanding organizational IT/OT convergence exposes organizations to new cyber risks.
Industrial cyber risks can potentially lead to production downtime, loss of intellectual property,
physical damage, loss of reputation and even loss of life.
These risks have a generic yet unique nature- even the standard procedure of updating and patching
vulnerable ICS involves great complexity.
As the threat landscape continues to evolve, industries need to embrace a comprehensive and
continuous approach to cybersecurity in order to enjoy the benefits of digitalization. This includes
ongoing monitoring process and risk prioritization according to the risks’ potential impact and remedy
costs. This continuous process proactively governs and reduces cyber risks, hence, allowing better
up-time, productivity, safety and new smart production opportunities.
