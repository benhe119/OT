## Times are Changing
Traditional industries worldwide are undergoing a technological transformation, often referred to as
Industry 4.0, smart production, or industrial digitalization. Along with the promising business opportunities this brings, the increasing organizational IT/OT convergence exposes organizations to new cyber risks.
Industrial cyber risks can potentially lead to production downtime, loss of intellectual property,
physical damage, loss of reputation, and even loss of life.

These risks have in common that even standard procedures for updating and patching
vulnerable ICS now involve great complexity.

As the threat landscape continues to evolve, industries must embrace a comprehensive and
continuous approach to cybersecurity in order to enjoy the benefits of digitalization. This approach should include ongoing monitoring, and risk prioritization according to potential risk impact and remedy
costs. This continuous process should proactively manage and reduce cyber risks, allowing better
up-time, productivity, safety, and new smart production opportunities.
